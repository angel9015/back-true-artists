## Testing ActionMailbox in development

#### Configuration
Domain **trueartists.xyz** has already registered and verified on SendGrid.
If you don't want to change domain, skip into 3.

1. Authenticate email domain on SendGrid.
2. Add fowlloing SMTP configuration.

```
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
  user_name: 'apikey',
  password: Rails.application.credentials[:SENDGRID_APIKEY]
  domain: [Test Domain],
  address: 'smtp.sendgrid.net',
  port: 587,
  authentication: :plain,
  enable_starttls_auto: true
}
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true
config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false
config.action_mailbox.ingress = :sendgrid
```
3. Install ngrok and run it.
4. Go to [SendGrid Inbound Parse](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/parse) page and add Host & URL.
```
https://actionmailbox:**INGRESS_PASSWORD**@**SERVER_PUBLIC_URL**/rails/action_mailbox/sendgrid/inbound_emails
```
* Check **POST the raw, full MIME message** option.

For example:
> https://actionmailbox:TrueArtists@3a61d.ngrok.io/rails/action_mailbox/sendgrid/inbound_emails
